Manual:

Enter 1 to encrypt a message, 2 to decrypt a message or 3 to exit. Any other input will return you to the 3 options.

To encrypt a message you need to write a key. After writing the key, the user will be asked to write a message.
The message will replace all 'j' or 'J' to i. All characters to lower case. It will add an 'x' between double characters
and if the length of the word is an odd number it will append a 'z' in the end of the word. For instance: message "tiii"
will be displayed as ti ix iz

The key needs to be less than 25 words and it needs to be characters inside the english alphabet without 'j' or 'J'.
If the user types 'j' it will get deleted, if the user types any unwated character from the unwanted character list
the the character will get deleted such as "! H r#pI" will be transformed into "hrpi" or "jipo" will be "ipo".

To decrypt a message the user needs to type 2. Then it will get asked to write a key again. If the key is the same as
before it will display the message, otherwise, it will display a wrong message.
